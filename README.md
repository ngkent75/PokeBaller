Have your Pokemon trading card collection on any device with PokeBaller!

To access the deployed site, go to https://pokeballer.herokuapp.com

## Built With

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)
* [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)
* [pokemontcgsdk](https://pokemontcg.io/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Context

Originally built as a project for a Trilogy Education Services full-stack web development bootcamp, PokeBaller has been refined and shows a grasp of Model-View-Controller concepts, Handlebars implementation, and front-end design with Bootstrap.

Here is the [powerpoint](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KbDNIhyXNIpK5oZnzSKNHNqseoR5SB3wPzDyNt7kMuY/edit#slide=id.p) explaining the original project.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running - follow steps below! 

After cloning into your IDE and changing directory into the Pokeballer folder:

1) Rename the .env copy file to just .env
2) Go to the Pokemon Trading Card docs, get an API key & paste into .env.
3) Run "npm i" in your terminal to install dependencies.
4) Make sure mySQL is connected on your computer, then run the schema script (using plugin/Workbench).
5) In terminal, "npm run seed" to seed the database.
6) In terminal, "npm start" to begin a server.
7) The terminal will show a web address where the website is now running! Navigate there with CTRL + click and try out Pokeballer!
